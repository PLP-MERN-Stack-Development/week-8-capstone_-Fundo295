# 🐾 PawFinder SA

**PawFinder SA** is a full-stack web application designed to **help South Africans report, locate, and reunite lost or found pets** using modern tools like AI-powered image matching and SMS alerts. The app empowers everyday people, shelters, and animal lovers to collaborate in a single platform — with support for **low-data areas**, **townships**, and **multilingual communication**.

## 🌟 What This Project Is For

> 🧭 “Where did my dog go?”

Every year, over **500,000 pets go missing in South Africa**, but only a fraction ever find their way back. The current methods (Facebook groups, flyers, SPCA boards) are **fragmented, slow, and inaccessible to rural or low-income communities**.

## PawFinder SA solves this problem by creating:

- 📸 A **centralized online system** for reporting missing or found pets.
- 🔍 **AI-powered image recognition** to match lost and found reports faster.
- 📱 **SMS & WhatsApp alerts** for users without reliable internet or smartphones.
- 🌐 A platform that's **lightweight, mobile-friendly, and multilingual** (English, Zulu, Afrikaans).
- 🤝 A community-driven approach that supports **animal shelters and local rescuers**.
